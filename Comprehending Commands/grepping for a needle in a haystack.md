# grepping for a needle in a haystack

```bash

hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{c_CfZ8oMI9FhEFpEAFH1jXOxBwX.ddTM4QDL4IjN0czW}
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$
```

i had to again use the cat command and this time search a file called data.txt in the challenge folder which is inturn in the / directory and had to search for the flag it is given that the flag starts with pwn.college so i used that to search the file by entering that first before the path of the file
