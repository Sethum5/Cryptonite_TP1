# Implicit relative path

```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/$ ./challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /challenge directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ADi2lPqNboAE02i9zzeXdI-v4TJ.dFTN1QDL4IjN0czW}
```

i used cd command to change directory to challenge and then used ./run to run and get the flag
