# Position thy self


```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/build-essential directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ cd /usr/share/build-essential
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/build-essential$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gfwLU9_TrYS5n39wu8e1-DFkeb-.dZDN1QDL4IjN0czW}
```

first i tried manually changing the directory and getting the flag but it showed incorrect and also told what directory i was supposed to get into so then i changed from the current directory to the  directory i was supposed to get into and then ran /challenge/run to get the flag
