# Program and absolute paths

```bash
Connected!
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ANGqdKnwIr3j1Rl71ZVSdO_flD6.dVDN1QDL4IjN0czW}
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$
```

i had to acces the run program which is in challenge directory which is in turn in the / directory which i had to do so by running /challenge/run and then i got the flag
