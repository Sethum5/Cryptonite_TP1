# Learning complex usage

```bash
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{M64CifV6vzqZJNPjD4GQb7RNrDs.dVjM5QDL4IjN0czW}
```

i ran the argument along witht the location and the name of the file that contains the flag
